This is a sample database in Oracle RDBMS format. it is open-source. The hosting model is embedded, because the user does not directly input the information through a separate portal. Rather, the fictitious company inputs the information themselves. The PL and SQL stored functions are called in Python. createuser is for creating OT user and grant privileges, schema is for creating database objects such as tables, constraints, etc., data is for loading data into the tables, and drop is for removing all objects in the sample database.
